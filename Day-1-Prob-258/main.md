**GOALS OF INTERACTION DESIGN**

• Develop usable products
• Involve people
• Consider what people are good and bad at
• Consider what might help people
• Think through what might provide quality experiences
• Consider a person’s privacy concerns

**CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERACTION DESIGN**

• Users’ involvement
• Specific usability and user experience goals
• Iteration

**Double Diamond of Design**

1. Discover: problem
  * Discovering requirements
2. Define: problem space
  * Designing alternatives to current solutions
3. Develop: potential solutions
  * Prototyping alternatives
4. Deliver: solutions
  * Evaluating product and its user experience (throughout)


**Conceptualization**

1. Conceptual Model
  * A high level description of a product in terms of what users can do with it 
    and the concepts they need to understand on how to interact with it.
2. Why conceptualize design?
  * How feasible are the benefits?
  * How realistic?
  * How desirable and useful?
3. BENEFITS OF CONCEPTUALIZING
  • Orientation
  • Open-minded
  • Common ground 
4. CORE COMPONENTS
  • Metaphors and analogies
  • Concepts that people are exposed to through the product
  • Relationship and mappings between these concepts 
5. INTERFACE METAPHORS
  • Conceptualizing what users are doing
  • For instance, surfing the Web
  • A conceptual model instantiated at the interface
  • For example, the desktop metaphor
  • Visualizing an operation
  • For instance, an icon of a shopping cart into which the user places items

**Direct Manipulation (DM)**

* Continuous representation
* Physical actions and button pressing
* Rapid reversible actions with immediate feedback on object of interest

**DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTERACTION TYPES AND INTERFACE STYLES**

• Interaction type:
  • Instructing, talking, browsing, or responding
• Interface style:
  • Command, menu-based, gesture, or voice

**Paradigm**

* Shared assumptions, concepts, values, and practices
* Predominant theoretical frameworks or scientific world views
* In short, a paradigm is how people assume they will do something, these days we assume computers can talk to eachother over networks.
* Examples:
  • Ubiquitous computing
  • Pervasive computing
  • Wearable computing
  • Internet of Things (IoT)


**Vision**

* A driving force towards the future of tech, this impacts how everyone thinks about what tech will be in the future and 
  therefore gives everyone an assumption about how certain systems should work.
• Provide concrete scenarios of how society can use the next generation of imagined technologies
* Raise ethical questions such as, privacy and trust 

**Theory**

* Much like in science, theories give people the space to test different ypothesis' to figure out what is included in good design
* Can help identify factors relevant to the design and evaluation of interactive products
• Cognitive, social, and affective

**Model**

* A model in HCI is a representation or abstraction of interaction between humans and computers.
  Models help in understanding and predicting user behavior, making interfaces more efficient and intuitive for users.
* Enables designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs. 

**Framework**

• Set of interrelated concepts and-or specific questions for ‘what to look for’ 
• Provide advice on how to design user experiences 
• Focus on how to design particular kinds of interfaces to evoke certain responses • Come in various forms: 
• steps, questions, concepts, challenges, principles, tactics, and dimensions

* A framework in HCI is a basic supporting structure for thinking about and doing HCI.
  It provides a way to organize and structure the process of designing and evaluating human-computer interactions.
  A framework in HCI often includes a general problem, its particular scope, research, knowledge, and practices.

**Cognition**

* Thinking, remembering, learning, daydreaming, decisionmaking, seeing, reading, talking, writing…
* Slow vs fast thinking

* Design Implications

  * Attention
    * Make information salient when it needs to be attended to at a given stage of a task:
      * color, ordering, spacing, underlining, sequencing, and animation
    * Avoid cluttering
    * Consider designing different ways to support effective switching and returning to an interface

  * Perception
    * Icons should enable users to distinguish their meaning readily
    * Bordering and spacing are effective visual ways of grouping information
    * Sounds should be audible and distinguishable
    * Research proper color contrast techniques when designing an interface
    * Haptic feedback should be used judiciously

  * Memory
    * Reduce cognitive load
    * Design interfaces that promote recognition rather than recall
    * Provide users with various ways of labelling digital information to help them easily identify it again

  * Learning
    * Involves the accumulation of skills and knowledge involving memory
    * Two main types:
      * Incidental learning
      * Intentional learning

**Perception**

* How information is acquired from the world and
transformed into experiences
• Obvious implication is to design representations
that are readily perceivable:
• Text should be legible
• Icons should be easy to distinguish and read

**Gulf of Evaluation**

* The gaps that exist between the user and the interface 

The World -> The User
What is the current system state?

• The distance from the physical system to the user

**Gulf of Execution**

* The gaps that exist between the user and the interface 

The User -> The World
How do I use this system?
• The distance from the user to the physical system


**Distributed Cognition**

Information is distributed through differen media

**External Cognition (Computational Offloading)**

Information is processed/stored externally
(Timers, contacts with phone numbers on your phone)

**Annotations and Cognitive Tracing**

* Modifying existing representations through making marks
* Externally manipulating items into different orders or structures

**Social Interaction**

We live together, work together, play together, talk to each
other, and socialize
  • Social technologies
    ▪ They differ in how they support us
    ▪ Some encourage social interactions
    ▪ Others have a negative impact on everyday conversations 

**Digial Bubbles**
* People in same room all buried in their devices

**Conversational Rules**
* Implicit conversational rules that most humans can understand wasily is harder for computers, and are the rules the same
  in text based chatting?
    Short answer, kinda

**Telepresence**

* Being present in a irl location through remote means
    * Ex, facetime robot in a room, multiple conference rooms telepresenting in one teams call

TELEPRESENCE AND SOCIAL
PRESENCE
• Telepresence refers to one party being present with
another party, who is present in a physical space
• Social presence refers to the feeling of being there
with a real person when in virtual reality

**Co-presence**

* Co-located groups who want
to collaborate

CO-PRESENCE: COORDINATION
MECHANISMS
  • When a group of people act or interact together,
  they need to coordinate themselves
  • To do so, they use:
    • Verbal and non-verbal communication
    • Schedules, rules, and conventions
    • Shared external representations

**Emotional Interaction**

• What makes us happy, sad, annoyed, anxious, frustrated,
motivated, delirious, and so on?
• Why people become emotionally attached to certain
products?
• Can social robots help reduce loneliness and improve wellbeing?
• How to change human behavior through the use of
emotive feedback?


**Emotional Design**

* Donate now to save 3 dying children for only 3.99$ *BIG PICTURE OF DYING KID HERE*

the Model of Emotional Design, proposed by Don Norman. 
This model consists of three levels: Visceral, Behavioral, and Reflective.

1. Visceral Level: The visceral level is the most immediate and pertains to the initial impact of a design. 
It’s about the first impression, the look, the feel, the sound, or the smell of a product.
This level triggers basic human instincts and intuitions.
For example, the sleek design and the feel of a new smartphone in your hand can evoke a positive visceral response.

2. Behavioral Level: The behavioral level refers to the usability of the product, how it performs, and how easy it is to use.
It’s about the experience of using a product, the perception of its functionality, and the overall ease of use.
For instance, if a website is intuitive and easy to navigate, it can lead to a positive behavioral response.

3. Reflective Level: The reflective level is the most profound and involves conscious thought.
It’s about the personal and cultural meaning of a product.
This level involves the active consideration of a product, encompassing how it relates to us personally, its place in our wider environment, and how it reflects upon us to own and use it.
For example, owning a luxury car might make someone feel successful, reflecting a positive image of themselves to others.

**Affective computing**

> "How to use computers to recognize and express emotions as humans do"

Picard, 1998

**Emotional AI**

Automate the measurement of feelings and behavior using Al to infer them from
facial expressions and voice.

* Both are tracking the user through various methods in order to identify emotions.
EX
  * Cameras
  * Biosendors
  * Heart monitor

**Classifications of emotions**

* 6 core emotions
  * Sadness
  * Disgust
  * Fear
  * Anger
  * Contempt
  * Joy

**Persuasive Technologies AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGE**

• Pop-up ads, warning messages, reminders,
prompts, personalized messages,
recommendations, or Amazon 1-click
• Commonly referred to as nudging

Emotional technologies can be designed to persuade
people to change their behaviors

**NINTENDO’S POCKET PIKACHU**
• Developed to change bad habits and improve well being
• If owner does not exercise, the virtual pet becomes
angry and refuses to play anymore


**Sustainable HCI**
• Focus on designing tech interventions to help people
reduce their energy consumption
• An effective technique is to provide homeowners with
feedback on their consumption
• Simple infographics and emoticons are often most
powerful:
▪ Encourage people to reflect and see what they
can change to reduce their energy consumption
• Peer pressure and social norms are also powerful
methods 

**Antropomorphism**
Attributing human-like qualities to inanimate objects (for
instance cars or computers)

CLIPPY

**Interface Types**

* Command
* Graphical
* Multimedia
* Virtual reality
* Web
* Mobile
* Appliance
* Voice
* Pen
* Touch
* Gesture
* Haptic
* Multimodal
* Shareable
* Tangible
* Augmented Reality
* Wearables
* Robots and drones
* Brain—computer interaction
* Smart

**ICONS**
• The mapping between the representation and
underlying referent:
  • Similar
  • Analogical
  • Arbitrary
• The most effective icons are similar ones
• Many operations are actions making it more difficult
to represent them 
(Camera app has a camera icon, printer is a printer etc)

**Menu Styles**

Flat list: Good for showing large number of options at the
same time when display is small
Drop down: Shows more options on same screen
Pop-up: When pressed, command key for relevant options

**Living Lab**

Peoples' use of technology in their everyday lives

**DATA GATHREING**
FIVE KEY ISSUES
1. Setting goals
2. Identifying participants : probability (random)
or nonprobability (convenience) sampling
3. Relationship with participants : consent form
4. Triangulation : data, theories, investigator, or
methodological
5. Pilot studies
